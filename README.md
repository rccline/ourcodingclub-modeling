## Working through the Statistical Modeling Tutorial created by Our Coding Club, University of Edinburgh. 

Our Coding Club is a "positive peer-learning community" that has prepared Tutorials, Workshops and Courses in Data Science for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists. 

This repository documents my personal experience working through the exercises contained in the tutorials created by Our Coding Club. I am grateful to the group of students and professors at University of Edinburgh who have generously provided these materials and their support for these exercises.   

Access to the tutorals and Courses, together with links and contact info for Our Coding Club and its members are publicly available and can be accessed by [clicking here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/).
