## ANOVA is a linear regression  on a continuous response variable.  

We just did with the apples in *01-LinearModels.Rmd*: how does the mean yield vary depending on the spacing category? 

It is also a linear model, but instead of getting a slope that allows us to predict the yield for any value of spacing, we get an estimate of the yield for each category.

```{r}
anova(apples.m)
```


We will use the *ilri.sheep* dataset, also from the agridat package.  

**question**: Is the weight of lambs at weaning a function of their age at weaning?, with the hypothesis that lambs that are weaned later are also heavier.  

```{r results='asis'}
sheep <- agridat::ilri.sheep   # load the data

library(dplyr)
sheep <- filter(sheep, ewegen == "R")   # there are confounding variables in this dataset that we don't want to take into account. We'll only consider lambs that come from mothers belonging to the breed "R".

head(sheep)  # overview of the data; we'll focus on weanwt (wean weight) and weanage

sheep.m1 <- lm(weanwt ~ weanage, data = sheep)   # run the model
summary(sheep.m1)                                # study the output

```

**Table 1.** Estimate is Intercept when lamb is 0 days old.
```{r}
library(sjPlot)
library(sjmisc)
library(sjlabelled)  

tab_model(sheep.m1)
```

<br> 

* $lamb weight = 2.60 + 0.08(age)$

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(gtsummary)

sheep.m2 <- tbl_regression(sheep.m1, 
                     exponentiate = FALSE
                     ) %>% 
    add_global_p() %>% 
  add_glance_table(
    include = c(nobs, logLik, AIC, BIC))
sheep.m2

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('img/sheep.m1.PNG'))
``` 


### Weanage accounts for only 20% of the weight at weaning.  What if the sex of lamb influences weight gain?    

```{r results='asis'}
sheep.m2 <- lm(weanwt ~ weanage*sex, data = sheep)
summary(sheep.m2)

```

<br> 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('img/sheep.m2.PNG'))
``` 

<br> 

**Female weight = 3.66 + 0.06(age)** : The weight at 100 days would be 3.66 + 0.06(100) = 9.66 kg.  

**Male weight = 3.66 + [-2.52] + 0.06(age) + [0.03(age)]** : The weight at 100 days would be 3.66 - 2.52 + (0.06+0.03)(100) = 10.14 kg.  

### Visualize the data for weanage.  
* [Create *theme.clean*](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-vis-2/index.html)
```{r}
theme.clean <- function(){
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "plain"),             
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "plain"),             
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),

        legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "italic"),          
        legend.position = "right")
}
``` 


```{r}

      geom_point(aes(colour = sex)) +                                # scatter plot, coloured by sex
      labs(x = "Age at weaning (days)", y = "Wean weight (kg)") +
      stat_smooth(method = "lm", aes(fill = sex, colour = sex)) +    # adding regression lines for each sex
      scale_colour_manual(values = c("#FFC125", "#36648B")) +
