#### Import shagLIP.csv dataset^[Living Planet Index. (n.d.). Retrieved April 15, 2022, from https://livingplanetindex.org/home/index]   
* data represent population trends for European Shags on the Isle of May and are available from the Living Planet Index.  



```{r, include=FALSE} 

source("../scripts/theme.clean.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# or sys.source("your-script.R", envir = knitr::knit_global())
```

```{r fig.cap="**Figure 1**: Histogram of European shag population, zero-inflated Poisson distribution"}
shag <- read.csv(here("data","shagLPI.csv")) #, header = TRUE))

shag$year <- as.numeric(shag$year)  # transform year from character into numeric variable

# Making a histogram to assess data distribution
(shag.hist <- ggplot(shag, aes(pop)) + geom_histogram() + theme.clean())
```


The population variable is count abundance data (integers); thus a Poisson distribution. **Zero-inflated** skew towards the right.  

```{r}
(shag.p <- ggplot(shag, aes(x = year, y = pop)) +
    geom_point(colour = "#483D8B") +
    geom_smooth(method = glm, colour = "#483D8B", fill = "#483D8B", alpha = 0.6) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005)) +
    theme.clean() +
    labs(x = " ", y = "European Shag abundance"))
```

### A model with a binomial distribution.  
* binomial is not linear.  
* binomial models are **logistic regression** which rely on **log odd ratios**.  
* There is no **R squared value** to assess **goodness of fit**.
* Assess goodness of fit by looking at the difference between: 
  - `Null deviance` (variability explained by a null model; e.g. glm(damage_T_F ~ 1)) and
  - `Residual deviance` e.g. the amount of variability that remains after you have eplained the explanitory variable.  

Weevil_damage.csv:  Damage to Scot's pine by weevils.  Perhaps some blocks of pines witll be particularly vulnerable to weevils?  
 

```{r}

Weevil_damage <- read.csv(here("data/Weevil_damage.csv")) 

# weevil.summary <- summary(Weevil_damage)
# knitr::kable(weevil.summary, caption = 'Summary Table of Weevil Damage')


# Making block a factor (a categorical variable)
Weevil_damage$block <- as.factor(Weevil_damage$block)

# Running the model
weevil.m <- glm(damage_T_F ~ block, family = binomial, data = Weevil_damage)
weevil.m



```
**It looks like the probability of a pine tree enduring damage from weevils does vary significantly based on the block in which the tree was located. **

 Greater estimates still mean bigger influence of your variables, just keep in mind that it’s not a linear relationship! And finally, you won’t get a R squared value to assess the goodness of fit of your model, but you can get at that by looking at the difference between the Null deviance (variability explained by a null model, e.g. glm(damage_T_F ~ 1)) and the Residual deviance, e.g. the amount of variability that remains after you’ve explained some away by your explanatory variable. In short, the bigger the reduction in deviance, the better a job your model is doing at explaining a relationship.

```{r}
weevil.m2 <- glm(damage_T_F ~ 1, family = binomial, data = Weevil_damage)
#weevil.m2
tab_model(weevil.m, weevil.m2)
